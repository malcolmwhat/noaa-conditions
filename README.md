# NoaaConditions
This is an exercise from the book `Programming Elixir`. It is effectively
the same as idea as https://github.com/malcolmwhat/issues however I don't need
to credit anyone else for any of the code.

### The Exercise
In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
provides hourly XML feeds of conditions at 1,800 locations. For example,
the feed for a small airport close to where Iâ€™m writing this is at
http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KDTO.xml .
Write an application that fetches this data, parses it, and displays it in a
nice format.
(Credit for the exercise goes to Dave Thomas...)
